													<h3>Bucharest's Old Town Center</h3>
												</header>
												<p>The Old Town is one of Bucharest's earliest settlements, where structures date 
													back to the 15th and 16th centuries. Over the centuries, it has been the seat 
													of Romanian princes, a center for trade, a place to worship, and a crossroads 
													for travelers. It also managed to survive Ceausescu's 1980s razing of one fifth 
													of the city to build his vision of a new Socialist capital. After spending 
													decades as a slum, much of the Old Town has been gentrified and renovated 
													since the fall of communism.</p>
												<p>Yet while many historic buildings have been gallantly restored, still other 
													properties await their facelift. This contrast gives that much more charm to 
													the Old Town's pedestrian lanes and cobbled streets lined with bookshops, 
													theaters, restaurants, and cafés.</p>
												<p>Popular things to do here include visiting Curtea Veche, an open-air museum built 
													on the site of the Old Princely Court, once home to Vlad the Impaler, and the 
													National Museum of Romanian History with its fine collections of religious and royal treasures.</p>
												<p>The old town is located with the Bulevardul Bratianu to the east, Regina Elisabeta 
													to the north, the city river Dambovita on the south side and Calea Victoriei to 
													the west. What to see in Bucharest old town you wonder? Don’t let yourself be 
													fooled by the fact that it covers a rather small area, there is plenty of things 
													to do and see in Bucharests old town.</p>
												<p>Underneath the entire area of the Old Town there are vaulted caves and cellars of former 
													inns, shops and houses, as well as communicating hiding places and refuge passages. 
													Part of the vaulted caves of the disappeared Serban Voda Inn were uncovered and you 
													can see them in front of the National Bank Palace on Lipscani Street.</p>

											<h3>Dracula building</h3>
										</header>
										<p>When you go to Romania and visit Bucharest, definitely take the time to get to know the story of Vlad 
											a bit better. It is, if possible, even more, interesting then the fictional Dracula story, even though he was the inspiration for it.</p>
